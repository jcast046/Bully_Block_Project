## Overview
The **Cyberbullying Detection System** is a web application designed to enhance the safety and educational quality of K-12 public schools by integrating directly with the Canvas Learning Management System (**LMS**). By using a robust Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) pipeline, this system monitors and analyzes online communications in real time, alerting stakeholders to potential cyberbullying incidents.

## Features
- **Automatic Alerts:** Immediate notifications for suspected cyberbullying incidents to ensure rapid response by designated staff.  
- **Comprehensive Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface for viewing, reviewing, and managing potential incidents and alerts.  
- **Immediate Linkage to Security Personnel:** Direct communication channels to school security staff to quickly address and manage incidents.


## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js with Express**  
  - Handles backend logic, creates RESTful API endpoints, and efficiently manages real-time data.

### Frontend
- **React**  
  - Provides a dynamic and responsive dashboard for real-time alerts and analytics.

### Database
- **MongoDB**  
  - Stores user data, logs, and incident details; chosen for flexibility and scalability.

### Artificial Intelligence, NLP, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning
- **Python**  
  - Used for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training pipelines.
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)  
  - Handles tokenization, stop word removal, and some basic normalization tasks.
- **spaCy**  
  - Used for more advanced linguistic processing such as lemmatization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)**  
  - Transforms raw text into numerical feature vectors for both traditional ML and DL models.
- **scikit-learn**  
  - Offers classical machine learning algorithms, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.
- **TensorFlow (Keras)**  
  - Implements deep learning architectures (CNNs, LSTMs) with dropout, spatial dropout, and learning-curve visualizations.
- **PyTorch**  
  - Provides alternative CNN and LSTM implementations using tokenized text (for embeddings) or TF-IDF vectors, employing batch normalization and dropout layers.

### Build & Integration Tools
- **Webpack**  
  - Bundles and optimizes frontend assets.
- **Babel**  
  - Transpiles modern JavaScript for compatibility with a range of browsers.
